<h2>Convert allele balance peaks to ploidy</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Converts allele balance data produced by <code>freq_peak()</code> to a copy number by assinging the allele balance data (frequencies) to its closest expected ratio.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
peak_to_ploid(x)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object produced by <code>freq_peak()</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Converts allele balance data produced by <code>freq_peak()</code> to copy number.
See the examples section for a graphical representation of the expectations and the bins around them.
Once a copy number has called a distance from expectation (dfe) is calculated as a form of confidence.
The bins around different copy numbers are of different width, so the dfe is scaled by its respective bin width.
This results in a dfe that is 0 when it is exactly at our expectation (high confidence) and at 1 when it is half way between two expectations (low confidence).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list consisting of two matrices containing the calls and the distance from expectation (i.e., confidence).
</p>
